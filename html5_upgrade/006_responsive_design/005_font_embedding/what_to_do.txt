1. First we'll need a font. Grab a font kit from: http://www.google.com/webfonts/

2. Set the page h1 to the font you chose.

Where to get fonts:

You can get more free fonts from: http://www.google.com/webfonts/ or www.fontsquirrel.com

If you would like a premium font, my choice is: http://www.myfonts.com.
