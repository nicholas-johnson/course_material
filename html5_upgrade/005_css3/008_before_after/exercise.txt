Boring Exercises

1. Remember attribute selectors from part 1? Add a set of hyperlinks and put a bit of "external link" text next to each one with a rel=external attribute. e.g.

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/link">dull internal link</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.google.com" rel="external">This link should have a text next to it</a>
  </li>
</ul>
