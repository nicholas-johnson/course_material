# Form Styling

You can check for a valid or invalid element using the new :valid and :invalid pseudoclasses, like so:

    :invalid {
      border:1px solid red;
    }

You should treat this as an enhancement for immediate validation feedback to the user. Some users will not see these styles, so include other forms of feedback on your form.

## readonly

You can also check for a readonly attribute using the new :readonly pseudoclass

## Required

You can check if an element is required using the new :required and :optional pseudoclasses

## Exercise

Style your form nicely with feedback to the user.
