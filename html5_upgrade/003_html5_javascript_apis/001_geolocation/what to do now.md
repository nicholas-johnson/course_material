# Geolocation

The Geolocation API allows us to request the current location of the user's browser. A little popup will appear asking the user if this is OK. It may well not be, so we need a contingency if the location is not available.

You can see a live example of this at:

http://www.streetbank.com/signup

The site will request the user's location. If it is given, the map will zoom in and focus on the current position.

## Developer Exercise

Using the example code, create a page which show's the user's current position on a Google map, plus their latitude and longitude. You could solve this by cutting and pasting, try instead to recreate the code in your own style.

## Designer Exercise

The sample code creates a map. Notice how the Streetbank site places the map at the top of the page, full width with a nice dropshadow. Try to recreate this styling.
