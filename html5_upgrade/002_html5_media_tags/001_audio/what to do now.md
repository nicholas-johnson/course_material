The easiest way to make ogg files is using an online service called firefogg. http://firefogg.org/

Take an MP3 and convert it. Create a page with embedded audio that works in Firefox, Chrome and IE. Use a link to the file as a fallback.

# Designer Exercise

You can style the audio player with CSS. Use Firebug to experiment with your styling options. Set the width, height and border.
