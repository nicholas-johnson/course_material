Notes

* When the internet was first dreamed up, most pages were simple articles with a top level headers, sub headers, paragraphs, etc.
* The internet has moved on though, and now we have more complex pages, with stuff all over the place.
* However, until now, all we have had to create these new types of pages are divs and spans
* HTML5 fixes all that.
